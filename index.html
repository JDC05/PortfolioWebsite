                                    Focusing on 3D, I learned to produce a simple shooter game using blueprints. The aim of the game is to hit all the targets
                                    in the world using a gun before the time limit and allows the user to restart the game. Creating this project helped me to
                                    understand how to manipulate physics in the game. I also learned to create a castle enviornment and used Quixel bridge to 
                                    acquire content to design it. This project invloved Sculpting/painting the landscape, creating a castle using modular

                                    Procedural Programming is achieved through abstract data types.
                                    Through Object-Oriented Programming, I created a Trading App Simulator whereby the user can buy/sell

                                    Through the extensive use of google docs and Excel, I establish the history of GPUs; how they 
                                    first came about, what different companies have done and why some haven't worked out which 
                                    resulted in only two remaining competitors left. I also provide data of real companies in the 
                                    charts I produced to give a clear and realistic understanding of the market side of GPUs.
